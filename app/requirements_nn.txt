# Neural Network Dependencies (Optional)
# These are only needed if you want to use the neural network features:
# - MLP "The Prophet" for fast fitness estimation
# - LSTM "The Oracle" for early stopping predictions
# - CNN "The Eye" for visual quality assessment
#
# EA and SOM work perfectly WITHOUT these packages.
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements_nn.txt
#
# Or install in separate virtual environment:
#   python3.11 -m venv venv_tf
#   source venv_tf/bin/activate  # or venv_tf\Scripts\activate on Windows
#   pip install -r requirements_nn.txt

# Deep Learning Frameworks
tensorflow>=2.18.0
keras>=3.6.0

# Additional dependencies for NN
joblib>=1.3.0        # For loading ML model scalers
Pillow>=10.0.0       # For image processing (CNN)
opencv-python>=4.8.0  # For image processing (CNN)
