# Guide to Understanding the EA Output Structure

This document describes the structure and content of the output directory generated by a run of the Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). The structure is designed to provide both a high-level overview of the entire evolutionary process and detailed results for each individual configuration that was evaluated.

## Root Directory Structure

A typical EA output directory (e.g., `results/20240918_120000/`) contains files summarizing the evolution and a main `individuals/` directory holding the detailed results.

*   **`results.csv`**: The primary summary file. Contains a single row for every evaluated individual, including its UID, all hyperparameter values, and all final performance metrics.
*   **`pareto_front_log.txt`**: A human-readable log of the best solutions (the Pareto front) found at the end of each generation. This file is key for identifying the final set of optimal trade-off solutions.
*   **`individuals/`**: A directory containing a subdirectory for each unique individual (configuration) evaluated during the evolution.
*   **`log.txt`**: A detailed, timestamped log of the entire EA process, including system messages and errors.
*   **`status.csv`**: A technical log tracking the start, completion, or failure of each individual evaluation task.
*   **`csv/`** & **`json/`**: Directories containing the data artifacts from the **initial preprocessing step** that was used for the entire evolution (e.g., `training_data.npy`, `ignore_mask.csv`, `preprocessing_info.json`).

## 1. High-Level Summary Files

These files provide an aggregated view of the entire optimization run.

*   ### `results.csv`
    This is the most important file for detailed analysis. Each row corresponds to a single SOM training run (an "individual") and contains:
    *   `uid`: The unique ID (hash) of the configuration. This ID matches the subdirectory name in `individuals/`.
    *   **Performance Metrics:** `best_mqe`, `duration`, `topographic_error`, `inactive_neuron_ratio`, `u_matrix_mean`, `u_matrix_std`, etc.
    *   **Hyperparameters:** All parameters from the `SEARCH_SPACE` that defined this individual (e.g., `map_size`, `processing_type`, `learning_rate`).

*   ### `pareto_front_log.txt`
    This file provides a human-readable log of the best solutions (the Pareto front) found at the end of each generation. The final section of this log contains the ultimate set of optimal, non-dominated solutions discovered by the algorithm. It is the best place to quickly identify the "champion" configurations for different trade-offs.

## 2. `individuals/` Directory - Detailed Individual Results

This directory is the core repository of detailed results. It contains one subdirectory for each unique configuration, named by its `uid`.

```
individuals/
└── 0a1efdf677031819f60b94c7f8b340cb/
    ├── csv/
    │   ├── weights.npy
    │   └── weights_readable.csv
    ├── visualizations/
    │   ├── mqe_evolution.png
    │   ├── learning_rate_decay.png
    │   ├── ... (other training graphs)
    │   └── maps/
    │       ├── u_matrix.png
    │       └── distance_map.png
    └── log.txt
```

### Structure of a Single UID Directory (`individuals/<uid>/`)

Each individual's directory contains the specific artifacts generated by its corresponding SOM run. This allows for a deep dive into the performance and results of any specific hyperparameter set.

*   **`csv/`**: Contains the final trained weights of the SOM for this individual.
*   **`visualizations/`**: Contains all plots generated during the evaluation of this individual.
    *   **Training Process Graphs:** `mqe_evolution.png`, `radius_decay.png`, etc., show the training dynamics for this specific run.
    *   **`maps/` Subdirectory:** Contains the final `u_matrix.png` and `distance_map.png`, which visualize the quality and structure of the trained map.
*   **`log.txt`**: A log file specific to the evaluation of this individual (if generated).

> **For a detailed description of the files inside each individual's directory (e.g., what `u_matrix.png` represents), please refer to the main [SOM Results Guide](../som/RESULTS.md).** The structure and content are identical to a single SOM run.
